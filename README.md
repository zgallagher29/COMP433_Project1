## Potential Build Issues & Fixes

* JDBC library not found -- to fix this, you'll need to change the path to the JDBC mysql jar under build path in Eclipse. The jar is available within WebStore/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47 in our project.

* Connection to the DB not working -- currently, Loyola's downtown IP is permitted to connect through AWS. If you have a different IP, please contact Riley so she can add your IP to conenct to the DB.
